# HLJT
Repository with the materials for an open-source version of the Hand Laterality Judgement Task (HLJT) for local and online use. These versions have been tested as in Moreno-Verd√∫ et. al 2025 (https://www.ibroneuroscience.org/article/S0306-4522(25)00180-0/fulltext | Preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.17.618819v1.full). Subsequent updates in native software (PsychoPy: https://www.psychopy.org/) may need adjustments. As developers, we are not responsible for implementing these in every use case.

The repository has two main folders, which contain PsychoPy experiments (.psyexp) and associated files to be able to run them locally or online. Please consult the Readme files for each version before using them (local and online versions are NOT equivalent). The Readme files contain extensive documentation on the most relevant experiment settings and detailed information to allow the user further customization.

The versions provided in this repository allow flexibility in terms of key experiment parameters of the HLJT (e.g. angles of rotation, hand views, types of response, trial-to-trial feedback, number of trials, etc). The optimal protocol is at the user's discretion, but sensible defaults have been implemented.
